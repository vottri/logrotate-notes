# Introduction

Logrotate is used in most Linux distribution like Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOS, ... for managing logs that are generated by the Linux machine.

Logrotate manages logs by rotating, compressing, or removing logs automatically on daily, weekly, monthly basis or as per the size of the logs (as it grows).

There are several reasons for using logrotate:

 - If log files were not rotated, compressed, and periodically pruned, they could eventually eat up a lot of your disk space.

 - When analyzing log data, you don't want those log files to be extremely large and long (not sure the exact log message you are looking for).

 - Also, logrotate help you oraganize log files by dates to make tracking and analyzing changes easier.

The moving parts that make logrotate run on any Linux machine are:

 - The **logrotate** command itself. (**/usr/bin/logrotate**) 

 - Logrotate's configuration file **/etc/logrotate.conf**. This file holds the configuration for all log files that Logrotate manages.

 - A daily cron job **/etc/cron.daily/logrotate** that issues the logrotate command to run everyday based on settings in its configuration file. 
   (You can wait for logrotation to happen when the cron runs or you can also run the logrotate command manually: **/usr/sbin/logrotate /etc/logrotate.conf**)
   
 - If you look inside **/etc/logrotate.conf**, you will see that it has the line **include /etc/logrotate.d** in it. What this line does is tell **Logrotate** to look inside the **/etc/logrotate.d** directory and run every configuration file in it. This directory is typically where applications installed on your linux system will add their logrotate configurations. For example, Apache2 will typically create a **/etc/logrotate.d/apache** configuration file upon installation.

 - When you try to look inside **/var/log** or any of its sub-directories, you may encounter log files with names such as **daemon.log.1** , **daemon.log.2.gz** , and so on. What are these log files? They are "rotated" log files. They have automatically been renamed after being rotated with a predefined time-frame (hourly, daily, weekly,...) and a new original log file (**daemon.log**) is created in their place. Some of the log files are compressed with the gzip utility, for example **daemon.log.2.gz** . 

**Summary**: The purpose of **log rotation** is to archive and compress old logs so that they consume less disk space, but are still available for inspection if needed. What handles this functionality? the **logrotate** command. Basically, logrotate is called from the system-wide cron script **/etc/cron.daily/logrotate**, and further defined by the configuration file **/etc/logrotate.conf**. Individual configuration files can also be added into **/etc/logrotate.d** (where the apache2 and mysql configurations are stored for example). 

# Set up an example config for Logrotate 

### Install Logrotate.

Most Linux systems come with Logrotate installed by default. Check if you have it installed on your VMs by issuing the **logrotate** command. 

If you don't have it installed, perform the steps below to install logrotate:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install logrotate
```

### Create a new test log file for logrotate demonstration.

```sh
sudo mkdir /var/log/myapp
sudo touch /var/log/myapp/myapp.log
```

![myapp-log](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vottri/logrotate-notes/main/images/myapp-log.png)

### Create a script to generate logs for your test log file.

Create a script.

```sh
sudo nano log_gen_script.sh
```
```sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "$(date '+%b %d %H:%M:%S') $(hostname) MyApp[2022]: MyApp's log messages"  >> /var/log/myapp/myapp.log
```

Make your script executable.

```sh
sudo chmod 755 log_gen_script.sh
```

![loggenscript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vottri/logrotate-notes/main/images/loggenscript.png)

Open an editor to edit the **root** user crontab

```sh
sudo crontab -e
no crontab for root - using an empty one

Select an editor.  To change later, run 'select-editor'.
  1. /bin/nano        <---- easiest
  2. /usr/bin/vim.basic
  3. /usr/bin/vim.tiny
  4. /bin/ed

Choose 1-4 [1]: 1
```

This cron job will schedule the script to run every minute.

```sh
* * * * * /home/cloud_user/log_gen_script.sh
```

### Create a new Logrotate configuration

To manage log files using logrotate for applications outside of the pre-packaged and pre-configured system services, create a new Logrotate configuration file and place it in **/etc/logrotate.d/**. This will be run daily along with all the other standard Logrotate jobs.

```sh
sudo nano /etc/logrotate.d/myapp
```
The name of the file doesn't really matter but the contents of the file should look something like this.

```sh
/var/log/myapp/myapp.log {
        size 100
        missingok
        rotate 3
        dateext
        dateformat -%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S
        create 644 root root
}
```

The configuration options in the content above instruct Logrotate to:

 - **/var/log/myapp/myapp.log**:  the path where logrotate will monitor the log file.

 - **size 100**: Rotate the log file when file size reaches a specific limit (greater than or equal to 100 byte in this case).

 - **missingok**: Do not generate error messages if the log file to rotate is missing.

 - **rotate 3**: Limit the number of log file rotation. So, this would keep only the recent 3 rotated log files and will delete the oldest logs when there are already 3 files to add new one.

 - **dateext**: Add date to rotated log file name.
 
 - **dateformat -%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S**: Format the date you plan to add to log file name.
 
 - **create 644 root root**: rotate the original file and create the new file with specified permission, user and group.

If you left everything as default, logrotate will be running everyday.

To ensure logrotate is running every 5 minutes. Add another line to your **root** crontab file.

```sh
sudo crontab -e
```

This will force the logrotate command to run every five minute.

```sh
*/5 * * * * /usr/sbin/logrotate /etc/logrotate.d/myapp
```

Your two cron jobs work together to demonstrate a basic example of log rotation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Log rotation is the process that renames a current log file (example: "myapp.log" becomes "myapp.log.1") and replaces it with a diffrent log file ("myapp.log") for continuing log entries.

Eventually this will keep following the setup of rotated log files:

myapp.log.3

myapp.log.2

myapp.log.1

myapp.log

While the log rotating process is running, you might see:

"myapp.log.1" becomes "myapp.log.2" and current log file becomes "myapp.log.1" before the new log file ("myapp.log") is created in place of it.

or 

"myapp.log.2" becomes "myapp.log.3" (with the old "myapp.log.3" disappeared) depends on the number of log files configured to be retained. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this note's example, I configure logrotate to add date-time format to the rotated log files, as you can see:

Every five minute, your test log file will get trimmed once. The old trimmed parts will be renamed with the suffixes according to the time-frame.

![myapp-log1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vottri/logrotate-notes/main/images/myapp-log1.png)

This shows here that after counting 3 rotated log files, it will simply delete the oldest one.

Logrotate removes an older log file "**myapp.log-2022-12-30_02:00:01**" so it can add a new one "**myapp.log-2022-12-30_02:15:01**"
